# SQL-PowerBI-Bank-Loan-Analysis

The Bank Loan Analysis Project utilizes SQL to perform comprehensive analysis on loan data, helping to identify patterns, trends, and key factors influencing loan performance. By leveraging SQL queries, the project categorizes loans into good loans (fully paid or current loans) and bad loans (charged-off loans), providing insights into borrower behavior, loan defaults, and trends and identify key factors influencing loan defaults. 
Power BI is employed to visualize the insights from the data analysis. The dashboard is divided into two key sections:
- Overview: Provides a high-level summary of loan performance, including total loan amounts, loan applications, payments, and average interest rates.
- Detail Analysis: Focuses on the breakdown of good loans and bad loans, delving into various factors such as loan purpose, borrower income, employment length, loan term, credit grades, regions, and home ownership status.
