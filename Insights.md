- **Total Loan Applications and Amounts:** there are 39,000 loan applications, representing a total loan amount of 436 million (M) and total payments amounting to 473M. This shows a strong level of activity in loan disbursement and repayment.
- **Average Interest Rate and DTI:** The overall average interest rate is 12.05%, reflecting the cost of borrowing across all loans. The average debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is 13.33%, indicating the level of debt obligations relative to borrowers' incomes.
- **Monthly Trend**: There is a clear upward trend in loan applications, loan amount and payment throughout the year, peaking towards October to December, which could indicate increased financial needs towards the end of the year, possibly due to holidays or year-end expenses.
- **Loan to Income by Income Category**: Borrowers in the high-income category (with an annual income > 100,000) take on the largest average loan amounts compared to low and moderate-income borrowers. However, the average loan-to-income ratio in the moderate-income group and high-income group are similar, indicating that while high-income borrowers may take out larger loans, the proportion of loan amount to their income is comparable to that of moderate-income borrowers.
- **Loan Amount by Term**: Loans with 36-month terms account for 295M in total loan amounts, while 60-month loans make up 178M. This suggests that shorter-term loans are more popular or are given higher loan amounts.
- **Loan Applications by Purpose**: The top reason for taking out loans is debt consolidation, with 18K applications, followed by credit card repayment with 5K applications. Other common purposes include home improvement and major purchases, each contributing significantly to the overall loan portfolio. The Bottom 5 purposes represent smaller portions of the overall loan distribution. Moving (559 applications), house-related loans (366), vacations (352), and educational expenses (315) are more niche, with renewable energy (94) showing the least demand. 
- **Loan Applications by Home Ownership**: Both homeowners and renters are significant borrowers, with mortgages account for 47.8% of loan applications, while 44.58% of applications are from renters.
- **Loan Applications by State**: California (CA) has the largest number of loan applications, followed by states like Texas (TX), New York (NY), and Florida (FL). These states are likely hubs of economic activity, leading to higher demand for loans.
Smaller states also show loan activity, indicating widespread geographic distribution of borrowers across the U.S.
- **Loan by Employment Length**: Borrowers with >10 years of employment make up the largest share of total loans, with 8,870 applications, representing the most stable borrower group. Other groups, such as those with 2-5 years of employment, also show significant activity, but the total loan amounts and total payments are lower compared to longer employment lengths. This suggests that borrowers with longer employment histories are trusted with larger loan amounts.
